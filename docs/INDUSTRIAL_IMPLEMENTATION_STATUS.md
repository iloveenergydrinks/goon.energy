# Industrial System Implementation Status

## ðŸš€ What We've Built

Based on the Citadel.game concepts, we've created a comprehensive industrial and upgrading system for goon.energy. Here's what has been implemented:

### âœ… Completed Components

#### 1. **Material Tier System** (`/types/industrial.ts`)
- **5 Material Tiers**: From basic (T1) to legendary (T5)
- **Material Grades**: F through S grade based on purity (0-100%)
- **6 Core Attributes**:
  - Strength: Affects hull HP and module durability
  - Conductivity: Impacts power generation and energy weapons
  - Density: Influences mass and mobility
  - Reactivity: Processing speed and capacitor recharge
  - Stability: Research success rates and failure prevention
  - Elasticity: Damage resistance and stress tolerance
- **Material Categories**: Metal, Gas, Crystal, Composite, Exotic
- **Rarity System**: Common to Legendary classification

#### 2. **Blueprint Research System**
- **Indefinite Improvement**: No cap on research levels
- **Research Aggressiveness Settings**:
  - Safe: 95% success, 0.5x speed
  - Normal: 85% success, 1.0x speed
  - Aggressive: 70% success, 1.5x speed
  - Reckless: 50% success, 2.0x speed
- **Stat Focus System**: Players choose which stats to prioritize
- **Scaling Types**: Linear, logarithmic, and exponential decay for different stats
- **Industrial Espionage Risk**: Shared blueprints can be stolen
- **Blueprint Stasis**: Can't use blueprints while researching

#### 3. **Refining Process System**
- **Multi-Cycle Refining**: Each cycle increases purity but loses material
- **Facility Types**: Basic, Standard, Advanced, Specialized, Capital
- **Efficiency Calculations**: 
  - Base efficiency: 50-95% depending on facility
  - Specialization bonuses: +15% for matching materials
  - Diminishing returns per cycle
- **Simulation Interface**: Preview refining outcomes before committing
- **Byproduct System**: Chance to get valuable trace elements

#### 4. **Calculation Library** (`/lib/industrial/calculations.ts`)
- Material tier determination based on purity
- Stat bonus calculations from material quality
- Material-requirement matching scores
- Special ability rolls based on material tiers
- Item quality calculations
- Research success probability
- Production time estimates
- Transport cost calculations
- Market price dynamics

#### 5. **UI Components**
- **MaterialCard**: Display material properties with tier/grade visualization
- **MaterialComparison**: Compare multiple materials against requirements
- **BlueprintResearch**: Configure and monitor research progress
- **BlueprintList**: Browse and select blueprints
- **RefiningInterface**: Plan and execute refining operations with live simulation

### ðŸ“‹ Integration Points with Existing System

The industrial system integrates seamlessly with your current fitting system:

1. **Enhanced Module Creation**:
   - Existing modules can now be crafted with varying material qualities
   - Higher tier materials grant stat bonuses to modules
   - Special abilities can emerge from premium materials

2. **Hull Manufacturing**:
   - Hull stats scale with material quality
   - Power capacity and bandwidth can be improved with better conductors
   - Structural integrity increases with higher strength materials

3. **Weapon Systems**:
   - Primary and secondary weapons benefit from material attributes
   - Energy weapons get damage bonuses from high conductivity
   - Kinetic weapons benefit from density and strength

### ðŸŽ® Gameplay Loop

```
1. Extract Resources â†’ Mine asteroids, gas clouds, salvage
                    â†“
2. Refine Materials â†’ Multiple cycles to increase purity
                    â†“  
3. Research Blueprints â†’ Improve stats indefinitely
                    â†“
4. Manufacture Items â†’ Combine blueprints + materials + facilities
                    â†“
5. Fit Ships â†’ Use manufactured items with quality bonuses
                    â†“
6. Trade/Combat â†’ Better equipment = competitive advantage
```

### ðŸ“Š Key Features

#### Material Effects on Final Products
- **Linear Bonuses**: HP, damage, power generation
- **Logarithmic Scaling**: Speed, rate of fire (prevents runaway stats)
- **Asymptotic Scaling**: Resistances, evasion (approaches but never reaches cap)

#### Risk/Reward Systems
- **Research Aggressiveness**: Faster progress vs higher failure chance
- **Refining Cycles**: More purity vs material loss
- **Blueprint Sharing**: Collaboration vs theft risk
- **Facility Investment**: Higher tier facilities = better output but higher costs

### ðŸ”® Next Steps

The following systems are designed but not yet implemented:

1. **Manufacturing Facilities** (TODO #4)
   - Production queues
   - Quality bonuses from facilities
   - Parallel job management

2. **Resource Extraction** (TODO #5)
   - Mining operations
   - Resource node depletion/regeneration
   - Territory control

3. **Supply Chain Management** (TODO #6)
   - Transport routes
   - Storage facilities
   - Security and insurance

4. **Material Quality Effects** (TODO #7)
   - Apply bonuses to manufactured items
   - Special ability activation
   - Durability and efficiency modifiers

5. **Industrial Espionage** (TODO #8)
   - Blueprint theft mechanics
   - Facility sabotage
   - Counter-intelligence

### ðŸ’¡ Implementation Recommendations

1. **Database Schema**: Update Prisma schema with new models (Material, Blueprint, RefiningJob, etc.)

2. **API Routes**: Create endpoints for:
   - `/api/materials` - CRUD operations
   - `/api/blueprints` - Research management
   - `/api/refining` - Process materials
   - `/api/manufacturing` - Production jobs

3. **State Management**: Extend `useFittingStore` or create `useIndustrialStore` for:
   - Material inventory
   - Blueprint library
   - Active jobs
   - Facility management

4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for:
   - Research progress
   - Refining completion
   - Manufacturing status
   - Market price changes

5. **Balancing Parameters**: Fine-tune in a config file:
   - Material drop rates
   - Refining efficiency curves
   - Research time formulas
   - Market volatility ranges

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements

The components use your existing design system with additions:
- **Color-coded tiers**: Grayâ†’Greenâ†’Blueâ†’Purpleâ†’Orange progression
- **Purity visualizations**: Progress bars and percentage displays
- **Grade badges**: S through F ranking system
- **Attribute spider charts**: Visual stat comparisons
- **Simulation previews**: See outcomes before committing resources

### ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics to Track

Once implemented, monitor:
- Player engagement with industrial activities
- Blueprint research progression rates
- Material market liquidity
- Average item quality distributions
- Industrial espionage frequency
- Supply chain efficiency scores

## Conclusion

The industrial system adds incredible depth to goon.energy, transforming it from a ship fitting tool into a full economic simulation. The material quality, blueprint research, and refining systems create meaningful progression and player choices that directly impact combat effectiveness.

The modular design allows for gradual implementation - you can start with materials and refining, then add blueprints, and finally layer on the advanced features like espionage and supply chains.

All code follows your existing patterns and integrates cleanly with your current TypeScript/React/Tailwind stack.
